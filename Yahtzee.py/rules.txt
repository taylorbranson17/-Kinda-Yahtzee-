Hello, welcome to Yahtzee!

The game rules are as follows:

1) The game is played in 13 rounds. Each player gets (1) turn each round.
2) During a players turn, they start by rolling (5) six-sided die.
3) The player can then choose to keep certain die and re-roll, or keep all of them and score that roll.
4) During a turn, a player can only roll a total of (3) times.
5) After the third and final roll, the game will present you with scoring options based on your last roll. 
    After choosing an option, it moves to the next player.

Yahtzee Rules:

1) Each player can only score (1) Yahtzee - or (5) of a kind- per game.
2) Each additional Yahtzee is marked in the 'Bonus' section, and is worth 100 points.
3) The player will then select another category to score in, or a (0) if no other options are present.
