# -Kinda-Yahtzee-
A built-from-scratch, fully functional, terminal line yahtzee game :) Written in Python, load/run main.py in your favorite interpreter and let the games begin!


Written in the Object-Oriented fashion, this began as an assignment from my Professor and friend, John Pannell.
Although it lacks a lot of comments and navigable documentation, this game is a ton of fun. It can be played with as many players as you can muster, 
and autocalculates scores, scoring options, and scorecards- creating a much more streamlined and efficient playing experience.
